         <p>Gaming has always been one of my consistant passtimes. My taste in genre has changed a bit as I've gotten older but I still like going back and playing games I enjoyed growing up. Some of my favorite games has to be Sekiro and the Kingdom Hearts Series, except for 3, it was pretty meh...</p>

         <p>I've always been into reading, but these last couple of months I've been diving deep into manga. I was more of an anime watcher before, but after seeing so many differences in various shows from the manga, I just couldn't watch anime the same way anymore. Some of the best mangas I've read so far has been Tokyo Ghoul and Berserk.</p>

         <p>Just listening to music is my all time favorite activity. Whether I'm just lying down with my headphones on, or when I'm at work which helps the day go by quicker. I like to get lost in music and my music taste is always expanding. Since my interest in music genre is always switching, it'd be hard to list down some of my favorite artists.</p>
